# DESIGN

## Wireframes

Prior to commencing the website coding process, comprehensive wireframes were produced for each page using Figma - a design tool used for creating user interfaces, prototypes, and wireframes. These wireframes served as the initial blueprints, providing a visual roadmap for the website's layout and structure on both desktop and mobile devices.

It's important to note that while the final web pages evolved from these early plans, some deviations were intentionally made to enhance the user experience and align better with the project's goals.

Despite the Recipes page not making its way into the final product, the wireframe for this section has been retained for reference. Similarly, the Sign-up page is absent in the final product, with a streamlined sign-up option conveniently accessible through the navigation bar on every page, as well as the call-to-action section on the home page.

This iterative process allowed for flexibility in adapting to evolving project requirements, ultimately contributing to the development of a more refined and user-friendly website.

# BUGS

### Fixed Bugs

- Issue: The hero image did not render correctly on mobile devices, resulting in a zoomed-in view on a small section of the image.
- Description: During testing on a mobile phone display, it was observed that the hero image was not rendering as expected. The issue was identified to be related to the "fixed" value in the background property, causing the image to display incorrectly and eliminating the intended parallax effect.
- Expected Behaviour: The hero image should render correctly on all devices, including mobile, without sacrificing the intended parallax effect.
- Steps to Reproduce:
  - Access the website on a mobile device.
  - Observe the rendering of the hero image, noting the zoomed-in view.
- Investigation and Solution:
  - Reviewed CSS properties for the background image.

- Steps to Reproduce: - Access the website on a small device in landscape mode.
  Navigate to any page.
  - Observe that the "Sign Up" button is not visible in the navigation bar.
    Check the call-to-action section at the bottom of the home page, where the sign-up option is still available.
- Investigation and Solution:
  Updated the Bootstrap class for the navigation bar from navbar-expand-sm to navbar-expand-md to ensure that the navigation bar hamburger menu comes in to affect on medium devices making the "Sign Up" button consistently visible.

### Known Bugs (unresolved)
