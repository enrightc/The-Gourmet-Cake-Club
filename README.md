# DESIGN

## Wireframes
Prior to commencing the website coding process, comprehensive wireframes were produced for each page using Figma - a design tool used for creating user interfaces, prototypes, and wireframes.  These wireframes served as the initial blueprints, providing a visual roadmap for the website's layout and structure on both desktop and mobile devices.

It's important to note that while the final web pages evolved from these early plans, some deviations were intentionally made to enhance the user experience and align better with the project's goals.

Despite the Recipes page not making its way into the final product, the wireframe for this section has been retained for reference. Similarly, the Sign-up page is absent in the final product, with a streamlined sign-up option conveniently accessible through the navigation bar on every page, as well as the call-to-action section on the home page.

This iterative process allowed for flexibility in adapting to evolving project requirements, ultimately contributing to the development of a more refined and user-friendly website.
